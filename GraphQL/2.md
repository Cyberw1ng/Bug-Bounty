# Exploiting GraphQL Vulnerabilities: How Misconfigurations Can Lead to Data Leaks

Introduction
GraphQL is a powerful API query language that allows clients to request exactly the data they need. While it improves flexibility and performance, improper GraphQL configurations can lead to serious security vulnerabilities, including:

🔴 Unauthorized data access
🔴 Sensitive information disclosure
🔴 Exploitation of misconfigured object IDs
🔴 Mass enumeration of private data

In a recent security report, a researcher discovered a severe GraphQL vulnerability that exposed sensitive data from a private system, earning a substantial bug bounty reward. This article explores how attackers exploit GraphQL vulnerabilities and how you can secure your APIs from similar threats.

1️⃣ How GraphQL Works and Its Security Risks
🔹 What is GraphQL?
